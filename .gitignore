Wait, I need to reconsider. The changes are only Rust source files (.rs), not build artifacts or dependencies. Let me check again.

The modified files are just Rust source code: `solution/src/dsl.rs` and `solution/src/services.rs`. These are regular source files, not build artifacts.

Since there are no build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files in the changes, and only source code files are being modified, the .gitignore should remain empty.
